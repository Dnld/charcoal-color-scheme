# Charcoal Color Scheme

Sublime Text 2/3 color scheme optimized for [babel-sublime](https://github.com/babel/babel-sublime) JavaScript syntax highlighting.  This is based on Dmitri Voronianski's fantastic [Oceanic Next Color Scheme](https://github.com/voronianski/oceanic-next-color-scheme).

## Installation and Activation

Use [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/) or just manually copy `Charcoal.tmTheme` file into `/Packages/User` directory (path to it depends on your OS).  Then select it from `Preferences` `->` `Color Scheme` `->` `User`.

## Contributing

If you'd like to add some rules and styles to the theme please do it inside `.YAML-tmTheme` file. Then `.tmTheme` xml can be generated with such tool as [AAAPackageDev](https://github.com/SublimeText/AAAPackageDev) for Sublime.
