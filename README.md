## Charcoal Color Scheme

Sublime Text 2/3 color scheme optimized for [babel-sublime](https://github.com/babel/babel-sublime) (also known as **6to5-sublime**) JavaScript syntax highlighting.  This is based on Dmitri Voronianski's fantastic [Oceanic Next Color Scheme](https://github.com/voronianski/oceanic-next-color-scheme).

## Installation and Activation

Use [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/) or just manually copy `Charcoal.tmTheme` file into `/Packages/User` directory (path to it depends on your OS). Then select it from `Preferences` `->` `Color Scheme` `->` `User`.
